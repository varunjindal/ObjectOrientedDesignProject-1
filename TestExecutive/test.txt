	This program is written to test Requirement 7 and 8 of this project.
	
	- Shall terminate a token collection after extracting any of the single character tokens: semicolon, open brace, closed brace. Also on extracting newline if a "#" is the first character on that line. Also, the extraction of a single character token consisting of ":" if immediately preceeded by one of the tokens: "public", "protected", or "private".
	
	- Shall provide a facility providing rules to ignore certain termination characters under special circumstances. You are required to provide a rule to ignore the (two) semicolons within parentheses in a for(;;) expression.
