	- alphanumeric tokens
	- punctuator tokens
	- special one and two character tokens with defaults that may be changed by calling setSpecialSingleChars(string ssc) and/or setSpecialCharPairs(string scp).
	- C style comments returned as a single token
	- C++ style comments returned as a single token
	- quoted strings
	- In this program every CPP comment says what tokens next line includes
